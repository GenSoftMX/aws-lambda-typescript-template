## Lambda Function Template with Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL Connection

This template provides a starting point for creating a Lambda function using Node.js with TypeScript and connecting to a PostgreSQL database. It follows a structured project organization with a focus on modularity and separation of concerns.

### Prerequisites

Before using this template, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm: [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/)
- TypeScript: You can install it globally via npm: `npm install -g typescript`
- PostgreSQL Database: You should have a PostgreSQL database set up and accessible.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   cd your-project-directory
   npm install
   ```

3. Place your `.env` file with PostgreSQL connection settings in the `test` folder. Example `.env` structure:

   ```
   HOST="host"
   PGUSER="user"
   PGPASSWORD="password"
   PGDATABASE="database"
   PGPORT=port
   ```

4. Configure your PostgreSQL connection settings in `src/loader/postgres.ts` file.

5. This command triggers the configured test suite, including Mocha for unit tests and Jest for coverage. It will scan the test directory for test files and execute them based on the settings specified in jest.config.ts. Ensure that your test files and configurations are properly set up before running this command.
   ```
    npm test
   ```

6. Build the TypeScript code:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

### Usage

Once deployed, you can invoke your Lambda function using the AWS Lambda console, AWS SDK, or HTTP triggers like API Gateway.

### Project Structure

- **index.ts**: Entry point of the Lambda function.
- **src/**: Contains the source code of the Lambda function.
  - **controller/**: Contains controllers for handling requests.
  - **datasource/**: Contains datasource classes for database connections.
  - **domain/exceptions/**: Contains exception classes for error handling.
  - **loader/**: Contains loader classes for initializing dependencies, such as PostgreSQL connection setup.
- **dist/**: Contains the compiled JavaScript code generated by TypeScript.
- **test/**: Contains unit tests with Mocha and Jest configuration.
  - **.env**: Environment variables file for testing purposes.
  - **jest.config.ts**: Jest configuration file for coverage setup.
- **serverless.yml**: Serverless Framework configuration file.

### Customization

Feel free to customize this template according to your project requirements. You can add more functions, endpoints, or modify the database schema as needed.
